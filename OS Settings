Desktop

I don't like the new Desktop, Stage Manager or Widget features in Sonoma, so I disable them.

System Preferences
Desktop & Dock
Desktop & Stage Manager
Show Items
On Desktop -> uncheck
In Stage Manager -> uncheck
Click wallpaper to reveal desktop -> Only in Stage Manager
Stage Manager -> uncheck
Widgets
On Desktop -> uncheck
In Stage Manager -> uncheck
Finder

Finder -> Preferences
General -> Show these on the desktop -> Select None
I try to keep my desktop completely clean.
General -> New Finder windows show -> Home Folder
I prefer to see my home folder in each new finder window instead of recent documents
Advanced -> Show all filename extensions -> Yes
Advanced -> Show warning before changing an extension -> No
Advanced -> When performing a search -> Search the current folder
View
Show Status Bar
Show Path Bar
Show Tab Bar
Dock

I don't use the Dock at all. It takes up screen space, and I can use RayCast to launch apps and AltTab to switch between apps. I make the dock as small as possible and auto hide it.

System Preferences
Desktop & Dock
Size -> Small as possible
Position on screen -> Left
Automatically hide and show the Dock -> Yes
Animate opening applications -> No
Show suggested and recent apps in the Dock -> No
